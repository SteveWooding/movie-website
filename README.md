### by Steven Wooding

Movie trailer website project, part of the Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer

## What it is and does

A Python program that produces the HTML for a movie website that displays
a number of movies. Click on a movie poster to play its trailer.

## Required Libraries and Dependencies

Python 2.x is required to run this project. The Python executable should be in
your default path, which the Python installer should have set.

## Project contents

This project consists for the following files:

* entertainment_center.py - main Python script to run
* media.py - contains the class Movie that stores movie details
* fresh_tomatoes.py - creates the HTML file for the website (Udacity supplied)

## How to Run Project

Download the project zip file to you computer and unzip the file. Or clone this
repository to your desktop.

Open the text-based interface for your operating system (e.g. the terminal
window in Linux, the command prompt in Windows).

Navigate to the project directory and type in the following command:

```bash
python entertainment_center.py
```

Your default browser should launch a new tab displaying the movie trailer website.

## Extra Credit Description

The following features were implemented to gain an extra credit from Udacity:

* Added the storyline of the movie to the website.
* Added the release date to the Movie class, which is also displayed on the website.
* Changed the background and text colour to create a dark theme for the website.
* Added subtle drop shadow to the movie poster images.
